          <h3>Blown glass, metal wire, sound</h3>
          <p class="wall-text">A series of glass plates were marbled with a combination of blues and whites. Some colourations are subtle while others are all consuming, in the same manner that our own feelings emerge. Using the familiar form of a plate stretched into organic silhouettes, I made no effort to control the uncontrollable, and allowed the colours to wharp and stretch as the glass was manipulated. Each plate is different, in both shape and colouration, alluding to the idea that we all experience emotions differently. By layering the plates together in a hanging installation, these shapes become windows into new perspectives. Observers are immersed in the installation and can speculate on the emotions represented in each layer of glass.</p>

          <h3>Cast Glass, December 2018</h3>
          <p class="wall-text">Each of these ‘Building Blocks’ holds a unique internal organ derived from a different 3D modeling technique. Much like our bodies, 3D modeling has a few primary processes; lofts, extrudes, revolves; that form the core of the program's functionality. To represent the vastly different formgiving potential of these processes, each organ was digitally subtracted from a cube and 3D printed to create burnout molds. Cast in clear glass, the blocks were brought to a high polish to reveal these internal structures. Unified by a consistent external form, each building block represents simple digital processes in a manner that would be very difficult to replicate by hand. The work highlights the potential for digital technologies to open up new possibilities in glass craft. This artwork is a finalist in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jamfactory.com.au/fuse-glass-prize">Fuse Glass Prize 2020</a></p>

          <h3>Alexandra Hirst, M.A. Glass</h3>
          <p class="wall-text">I first developed an interest in glass during my undergrad in sculpture through a university exchange program at Alfred University (NY, USA) and was instantly drawn to the complexity of the material, and the collaborative aspect of glassblowing. I’ve since developed my technical skill through university courses at ANU in Canberra, and a Masters in Glass at Edinburgh College of Art in the UK, where I explored integrating digital processes in glass blowing and creating large scale glass assemblies. I’ve assisted at studios including Backhaus Brownin Denmark and had the privilege of learning from and assisting leading glass artists worldwide. After completing my Masters, I joined the associate program at the Jam Factory to fully form my technical skills and build my practice. I predominantly use glass in my work, however to accentuate an artwork I may incorporate light, sound, mixed media and or people's interaction. </p>
